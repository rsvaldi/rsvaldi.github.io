<h2>
INDAM postdocs 2023 (application deadline: February 9th 2023)
</h2>
  

The 
<a href="www.altamatematica.it">INDAM
</a> 
(Italian Institute for Higher Mathematics) 
has advertised four 2-year postdoctoral positions. 

<h4>
Details on the position
</h4>
Exactly one of the 4 positions will be awarded to someone working on themes related to 
geometry, algebra and their Applications 
(these topics can be interpreted in a rather broad sense).
<br>
These positions are rather generously funded, at least for the standards of Southern Europe: 
the gross salary is &euro;35000/year corresponding to about &euro;2550/month after taxes; 
a fund of &euro;2500/year will also be available to cover for research-related expenses.

<h4>
Application requirements
</h4>
Applications will be considered only from those that have obtained their doctoral degree after 1.1.2022, 
or those that have yet to obtain one but plan to do so by 31.05.2023.
To apply, each candidate must select a Department of Mathematics at one of the public Italian universities, 
together with a mentor that is a permanent member of the chosen department. 


<h4>
Deadline for application and choice of dept/mentor
</h4>
Deadline for applications is February 9th, at 23:59 Italian time (aka CET).

<h4>
Research in AG at University of Milan
</h4>
The Department of Mathematics at the University of Milan currently has a large 
<a href="https://sites.unimi.it/geoalg/">research group in Algebraic Geometry</a> 
currently featuring 16 permanent members and 5 postdoctoral associates/researchers.
<br>
Research themes represented in the group cover a wide range of topics in modern AG, 
e.g., birational geometry, hyperkaehler varieties, stability conditions and moduli spaces, Hodge theory, algebraic foliations, derived categories, and many more.
We organise a weekly seminar and reading groups.

<h4>
Application procedure and files

  </li>
  <li>
	a list of publications, among which the candidate must indicate a maximum of 3 to be submitted for evaluation; 
  </li>
  <li>
	detailed indication of the proposed research program, 
  the INdAM Research Unit where it would be carried out, 
  and the mathematician with whom he/she primarily intends to collaborate and who would assume the direction of the research;
  </li>  
	<li>
  links to download, without copyright charges and restrictions, 
  the pdf version of the publications indicated by the candidate for the purpose of the selection process. 
  It is also possible to send the selected publications in PDF format by email to 
  <a href="mailto:cascianelli@altamatematica.it">
  cascianelli@altamatematica.it
