A 2-year postdoctoral position is available in the Algebraic Geometry group at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Milan.

<h4>
Interviews calendar
</h4>
All those that sent an application should have received an official email containing the calendar for the interviews.
  Interviews will be held online, on the dates indicated in the email you received, and they will consist of a short presentation that will have to last 15mins -- including questions from teh committee.
  
  
<h4>
Research topics
</h4>
The position is funded by the university on the themes of the project 
“Birational geometry and moduli spaces of algebraic varieties and foliations” 
that is coordinated by 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/lucatasin/">Luca Tasin</a>
and 
<a href="https://rsvaldi.github.io">myself</a>.
<br>
We are looking for candidates whose research interests are related to one or more of the following topics (all intended in the widest possible sense): 
birational geometry, geometry of varieties with trivial canonical bundle, algebraic foliations, boundedness problems.


<h4>
Deadline for application
</h4>
<p>
November 13th 2025 at 11h59 (am) Italian time (aka CET).
</p>
<p>
All informations on the selection process are available at this

<p> 
We have a prepared an informal translation in English of the formal job opening and rules for the hiring process which is available <a href="./bando_eng_pdoc_2025.pdf">here</a>. 
Please, do notice that our translation does not hold any legal validity, and all official information can be only checked in the original document.
</p>

<h4>
Starting date and duration of contract
</h4>

<p>
The duration of the contract is 2 years.
</p>
<p>
The starting date is no later than January 1st, 2026, due to the nature of the funding.

Do notice that this is an estimate and the correct amount may depend from personal circumstances (family situation, etc.).
<br>
For those that, at the start of the contract, will have been working abroad (i.e., outside of Italy) for at least the previous 3 years, it will be possible to claim a tax benefit that should increase the salary to about 
&euro;1900/month (over 13 monthly payments). 

<h4>
Research in AG at University of Milan
</h4>

<p>
The Department of Mathematics at the University of Milan currently has a large research group in 
Algebraic Geometry currently featuring 14 permanent members, 2 assistant professors, 3 postdoctoral researchers, and 2 graduate students.
<br>
Research themes represented in the group cover a wide range of topics in modern AG:
e.g., birational geometry, 
algebraic foliations, 
hyperkaehler varieties, 
stability conditions and moduli spaces, 
Hodge theory, 
derived categories, 
K-theory,
and many more.
<br>
We organise a weekly seminar and reading groups during each semester, and we invite many academic visitors.
<br>	
More information on the group and its members are available 
<a href="https://sites.unimi.it/geoalg/">here</a>.
</p>


<h4>
Application requirements 
</h4>

<p>
Holding a doctoral degree at the time of application is not a requirement for applying.
<br>
If not already held at the time of application, you will need to obtain your doctoral degree within 6 months of the date of posting of the call for the position, i.e., by April 13th 2026.
Moreover, if you are in this situation, and you are still pursuing your PhD, you must be enrolled in the 3rd year of a doctoral program: this may seem a strange requirement, but it is due to how the law has been (not very smartly) written.
</p>
<p>
Those already holding a doctoral degree obtained outside of Italy will have to obtain the formal recognition of its equivalence to an Italian degre (equivalenza or equipollenza).
Do not worry about that, we can help you with it.
<br>
The same rule apply to those that will obtain their doctoral degree by the deadline indicated above: in that case, the procedure for obtaining the formal recongition of the foreign degree will have to be initiated right after the awarding of the degree. 
Again, we can help with that.
</p>
<p>
For all the relevant information, about criteria and modality for application, please consult the official document of the call which is available at the 
<a href="https://www.unimi.it/en/node/53093">official page</a>
of application 
(<a href="./bando_erg_pdoc_2025.pdf">here</a> the unofficial English translation).
