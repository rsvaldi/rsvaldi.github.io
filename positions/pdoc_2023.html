<h2>
One 2-year postdoctoral position in algebraic geometry (deadline for application: January 3oth 2023, extended to January 31st due to technical problems on the file submission webpage).
</h2>

One 2-year postdoctoral position is available in the Algebraic Geometry group at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Milan.

<h4>
Research topics
</h4>
The position is funded by the university on the themes of the project 
“Boundedness and moduli problems in algebraic geometry and foliation theory” 
that is coordinated by 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/lucatasin/">Luca Tasin</a>
and 
<a href="https://rsvaldi.github.io">myself</a>.
<br>
Thus, we are looking for people whose research interests are related to 
birational geometry, geometry of varieties with trivial canonical bundle, algebraic foliations, boundedness problems 
(all intended in the widest possible sense).
 

<h4>
Salary
</h4>
 
The gross salary for the position is &euro;21000/year which, after taxes, corresponds to about &euro;1550/month. 
<br>
A mobility allowance of 
&euro;600/month 
will be added to the salary for those that satisfy the following 2 conditions:
they have obtained their doctoral degree, or are about to obtain one, from a university outside of Italy,
and, if already graduated with a PhD, are currently residing outside of Italy. 
Thus, the corresponding gross salary will then increase to 
&euro;28200/year, 
which after taxes corresponds to 
&euro;2050/month.
 

<h4>
Deadline for application
</h4>
 
Deadline for applications is January 30th, at 12h00 (pm) Italian time (aka CET).
The deadline has been extended to the same hour of January 31st, due to technical issues on the application submission webpage.
In case of further problems, please contact <a href="mailto:assegni.postdoc@unimi.it">assegni.postdoc@unimi.it</a>.
 

<h4>
Starting date and duration
</h4>
 
There is no fixed starting date for the position and there is some flexibility in choosing one.
Once the results of the evaluations will be published, the person who is awarded the position will be contacted by the University of Milan with a contract offer.
At that time, they can opt to postpone the starting date proposed by the university by up to 90 days, in agreement with the PIs of the project.
 

<h4>
Research in AG at University of Milan
</h4>
 
The Department of Mathematics at the University of Milan currently has a large research group in 
Algebraic Geometry currently featuring 16 permanent members and 5 postdoctoral associates/researchers.
<br>
Research themes represented in the group cover a wide range of topics in modern AG, 
e.g., birational geometry, hyperkaehler varieties, stability conditions and moduli spaces, 
Hodge theory, algebraic foliations, derived categories, and many more.
We organise a weekly seminar and reading groups during the semester.
<br>	
More information on the group and its members are available 
<a href="https://sites.unimi.it/geoalg/">here</a>.
