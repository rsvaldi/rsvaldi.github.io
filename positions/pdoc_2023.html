The Department of Mathematics at the University of Milan currently has a large research group in Algebraic Geometry currently featuring 16 permanent members and 5 postdoctoral associates/researchers.
<br>
Research themes represented in the group cover a wide range of topics in modern AG, e.g., birational geometry, hyperkaehler varieties, stability conditions and moduli spaces, Hodge theory, algebraic foliations, derived categories, and many more.
We organise a weekly seminar and reading groups during the semester.
